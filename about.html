  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Fusion of AI with Real-World Adaptive Dynamics (FAWAD) Lab, led by Dr. Fawad Khan, focuses on developing intelligent systems that integrate artificial intelligence, optimization algorithms, and dynamic modeling for real-world applications. Our research spans human-centric robotics, neuro-mechanical control, reinforcement learning, and physics-informed AI, aiming to create adaptive technologies that respond to complex biological and physical environments. We combine theory and practice across domains such as rehabilitation robotics, fluid dynamics, and computational biomechanics. FAWAD Lab actively collaborates with academic, clinical, and industry partners.</p>
